## About Me
I'm a 4th year engineering physics student at the University of British Columbia. I enjoy using a physics background to tackle a breadth of problems in the mechanical, electrical, and software engineering domains.

I've interned at Voltsafe on the Hardware team, D-Wave on the Cyrogenics team, and 4AG Robotics on the Mechanical team. I'm currently looking for a Summer 2025 internship with a keen interest in early deep-tech startups.

**If I look like a good fit for your team, please send me an [email](mailto:yoonhal@student.ubc.ca)**!
