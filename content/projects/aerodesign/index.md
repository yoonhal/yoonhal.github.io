This page is a WIP.

Led the structural design of the fuselage of a 
super-lift RC aircraft that weighed ~3lbs 
empty and flew with 2.2 lbs of water. I used 
FEA to optimize for weight-to-strength and 
performed physical validation via bending 
and torsional tests. I was also able to 
communicate with the electrical teams to 
manage wire and component layout, the 
wing team to design a flow-transition region, 
as well as delegating tasks in my own team 
to design and build landing gear and 
empennage connections. [Watch it fly.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uOOoVNV6pV89PoSJKm0G0iQgKjgImtV7/view)
