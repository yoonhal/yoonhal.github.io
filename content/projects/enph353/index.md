# (This page is a WIP)

## How?
- Designed, generated data, and trained a CNN to detect alphanumeric characters from an image.
- Utilized OpenCV to process and filter images from a simulated camera feed in Gym Gazebo.
- Developed imitation learning model and classical control algorithms to maneuver a robot on a simulated
road switching between states avoiding obstacles, following leaders, and obeying simplified traffic laws.
- Implemented a homography-based tracker using SIFT to highlight objects in a video feed.

## Results
- Agent was able to successfully maneuver across the entire world and predict all clues correctly.
- Learned how to use ROS and Linux (Xubuntu).
