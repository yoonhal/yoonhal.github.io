# (This page is a WIP)

## TLDR;

Built a robot capable of autonomously navigating a 
competition "race track" in a small team of 4. Took charge 
designing the chassis, steering mechanism, motor driver, 
and competition strategy, playing a pivotal role in allowing 
our team to become one of only two teams to successfully 
take a shortcut, a handful to complete a lap, all while being 
one of the fastest robots (finishing laps in ~10 seconds).
