## A One-Day Project
While thinking of interesting ways to pass our time over the short winter break, Kevin and I decided to tackle a project we could finish within 24 hours - a timeframe reminiscient of hackathons. We learned tons about web automation, web scraping, network socket, and UART while brushing up on old skills like coding in Python, coding in C/C++, simple circuit design, and applications of general engineering principles.
