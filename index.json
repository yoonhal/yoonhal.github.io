I enjoy using a physics background to tackle a breadth of problems in the mechanical, electrical, and software engineering domains.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve interned at Voltsafe on the Hardware team, D-Wave on the Cyrogenics team, and 4AG Robotics on the Mechanical team. I\u0026rsquo;m currently looking for a Summer 2025 internship with a keen interest in early deep-tech startups.\nIf I look like a good fit for your team, please send me an email!\n","date":"29 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Home Page","summary":"","title":"Home Page","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"29 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Projects","type":"projects"},{"content":"This page is a WIP.\n","date":"29 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/wpm-tester/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"WPM Torture Test","type":"projects"},{"content":"This page is a WIP.\nLed the structural design of the fuselage of a super-lift RC aircraft that weighed ~3lbs empty and flew with 2.2 lbs of water. I used FEA to optimize for weight-to-strength and performed physical validation via bending and torsional tests. I was also able to communicate with the electrical teams to manage wire and component layout, the wing team to design a flow-transition region, as well as delegating tasks in my own team to design and build landing gear and empennage connections.
